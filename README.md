## Listen to the Voices They're Ignoring

Every complaint is a competitive opportunity. Turn their user feedback into your feature wins.

## Competitive Intelligence for Scaleups

### **Size Isn't a Shield. It's a Target.**

Being big doesn't make you invincible; it makes you visible. And in business, visibility without vigilance is a death sentence.

![Integrations](https://github.com/wizenheimer/byrd/tree/main/frontend/public/integrations.png)

## Don't Be the Last One to Know

Spot emerging competitors long before they become existential threats. No more "how did we miss that?" moments.

### **Winning Is a Team Sport**

Bring in your heavy hitters. Keep everyone on the same page. When everyone sees the same signals, nobody misses the big moves.  
ðŸ”— [Stop Losing Intel in Endless Email Threads](/onboarding?source=S8C1)

### **Same Tools. No New Dashboards.**

Existing tools don't solve data silos; they create new ones and leave the plumbing for you. Byrd is built differently.
